# Does the United Nations peace agreements have an impact in conflicts resolution around the world ?

# Abstract
The United Nations often gets criticized for all the wars it could not prevent and its impact in our society is questionned. Our study will aim at giving a rational opinion in the impact of UN peace agreements and the development of wars. First we will make a map display of all violent events through history. We will then connect it to UN peace agreements and compare the growth or decay of violence in the concerned region. Also we would like to understand the similarities between violent events. We would like to establish a graph where those violent events are nodes and the edges are the similarity between them. They could hold as attributes the actors of the event, the intermediaries, the geological position, the side parties intervening etc...

# Research questions
A list of research questions you would like to address during the project. 

# Dataset
We will base our research on the UCDP dataset. As the UCDP dataset has a collection of violent events from 1946, we will probably extend our studies using the gdelt dataset. The size of the UCDP dataset allows us to download the csv files and work directly from our laptops. We will take advantage of the geocoded data to map our dataset on the world map. We will use the dyad indexes to connect the multiple datasets and create our graph. A dyad consists of two conflicting primary parties.

List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
