# UCDP Does the United Nations peace agreements have an impact in conflicts resolution around the world ?

# Abstract
The United Nations often gets criticized for all the wars it could not prevent and its impact in our society is questionned. Our study will aim at giving a rational opinion in the impact of UN peace agreements and the development of wars. First we will make a map display of all violent events through history. We will then connect it to UN peace agreements and compare the growth or decay of violence in the concerned region.
